just simple math, 

the formula of RSA key:

decrypted = (encrypted) ^ d mod N

for ease, I use RSA calculator here (or you could use wolfram alpha instead)
https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~introcs/Fa11/notes/10.1_Cryptography/RSA_Express_EncryptDecrypt.html

enter the value of: 

N = 435979
Ciphertext Message in numeric form = 150815
Decryption Key: d = 1941

you got the Decrypted Message in numeric form = 133337
